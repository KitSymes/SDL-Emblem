# SDLProject
This is a Turn Based Strategy game produced for University Coursework. It features a map with 6 levels to fight through, 3 save slots and a required Mario component.
Its gameplay and art style is heavily influenced by the Fire Emblem franchise.

This has been a joy to work on, and is my first real attempt at pixel art and my first "complete" game.

You can find a more detailed post on its mechanics, as well as images and gifs on [my Portfolio Site](https://kitsymes.github.io/sdl_emblem.html)!
